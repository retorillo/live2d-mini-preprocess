# Live2D Mini Preprocess

**WORKING IN PROGRESS**

The [original preprocess script](http://sites.cybernoids.jp/cubism2/tools/jsx) is classic and too strict.

In common, modern Cubism can loads PSD files that contains nested folders, smart objects, transparent layers, and so forth.

This project goal is to discover minimal preprocess script.
